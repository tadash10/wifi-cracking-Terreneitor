Cracking WPA and WPA2 networks without dictionary

The script provides an educational tool for automated Wi-Fi network testing with a cracking method without a dictionary. It does so by installing the necessary tools, checking compatibility, enabling monitor mode, starting analysis, and performing an automatic cracking attack using Hashcat. The script is designed to provide detailed information about each step and potential errors, enhancing its educational value. The separation of concerns into different modules makes the script modular and maintainable.
