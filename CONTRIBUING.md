Contributing to WiFi Security Test Script

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the WiFi Security Test Script. Your contributions can enhance the script's functionality, user experience, and educational value. We encourage contributions in various areas, and we are particularly interested in implementing the following features:
Interactive Configuration

Implement an interactive configuration process to guide users in setting up the script. Allow users to input essential parameters interactively, such as distribution, interface, handshake file, and security protocol.
Customizable Hashcat Parameters

Allow users to specify Hashcat parameters interactively during the configuration. Provide default values for Hashcat parameters but allow customization for advanced users.
Educational Resources

Include links to educational resources or brief explanations at each step to help users understand the purpose and implications of the actions being performed.
Progress Updates

Enhance progress update messages to be more descriptive and informative. Provide progress bars, status updates, and estimated completion times during lengthy operations.
Documentation and Help

Include a help option in the menu that provides information about each available option and guidance on how to use the script. Generate a comprehensive README file that explains the purpose, usage, and educational aspects of the script.
Safety Measures

Implement safety measures, such as confirming critical actions with the user before proceeding. Include a confirmation step before initiating actions that might have irreversible consequences.
Logging Improvements

Expand the logging system to capture more detailed information about each step, especially errors. Store logs in a dedicated log file for future reference and analysis.
Scenario Simulation

Provide options for simulating different Wi-Fi network scenarios, such as various security protocols and encryption methods, to enhance the educational experience.
Security Awareness

Integrate educational messages on ethical hacking, responsible disclosure, and the legal implications of unauthorized testing.
